    description:
      "This book was written because the universe will end—not now, but trillions of years into the future, according to science. If everything inevitably dissolves, what is the point of our existence?\n\nHere we will place humanity’s scientific discoveries of existence, space, and physics under a philosophical lens to find the truth to our existence and light the flame.",
